# Week 2 (Project Foundations)

## Setting up page and component folder and ensure routes work:

### for git hub page deployment:

*gitHub page does not work with BrowserRouter, you need version 5 of react-router-dom and HashRouter

### Other dependencies:

* icons:

$ npm i --save @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons

$ npm i --save @fortawesome/react-fontawesome@latest

## Adding meta tags and setting up OGP (Open Graph Protocol)

1) Add the appropriate description meta tag:

* In public folder, open index.html, inside <head> add <meta name ="description" content ="your text goes here">;

2) Add the og:title meta tag

* <meta name ="og:title" content = "" />

3) Add the og:description meta tag

* <meta name ="og:description" content = " />

4) Add the og:image meta tag
* <meta name ="og:image" content ="" />

3) Style the navigation elements

4) Style your images

5) Apply the rules to existing HTML elements

6) Verify that the HTML elements are styled correctly

* bootstrap and react-bootstrap

$npm install bootstrap react-bootstrap

# Week 3: Home, Footer, About, Menu

# Week 4: Reservation, Confirmation, Registration, Login

## Reservation

### Forms
* use Formik  to create forms and yup for form verification

$ npm install formik --save

import {useFormik} from "formik";

$ npm install yup react-yup

import *as Yup from 'yup';

### BookingSlots

* download react-datepicker

$ npm install react-datepicker --save

2. Code the form structure
* use sessionStorage and localStorage to store inputs

3. Create a local host data base API to mimic server side API

* create a folder outside of src name: data
* inside of data, create a new file name db.json, which would be a Object storage
* cut and pasted the menu items to the db.json
* ensure all data is in json format.
* open a new terminal window, create a REST API in localHost3500

$ npx json-server -p 3500 -w data/db.json
  const API_URL = '<http://localhost:3500/wineList>';

* No access to API outside of localhost, therefore, hosted API on github instead.  Since github API is raw data, I can only perform fetch not POST or any other http functions.

# Week 5: Order online

## Organize the data
* data folder inside SRC
* image folder inside public
* update product information inside data folder and uploaded into little_lemon_api

## ContextAPI
* created a context API to transmit functions and data needed for order online.

## Checkout and Stripe Payment
